# Pyrlang - Erlang node in Python

This is a drop-in Erlang node implementation in Python 3, implementing
a network Erlang node protocol. It was designed to allow interoperation between
existing Python projects and BEAM languages: Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, Luaerl,
LFE, Clojerl and such.

With just a few lines of startup code your Python program becomes an Erlang
network node, participating in the Erlang cluster.

## Features

*   Erlang distribution protocol for Erlang versions 19 to 25
*   Registry of Python 'processes', which have an Erlang-compatible process
    identifier and an optional registered name
*   Send and receive messages locally and remotely by pid or name
*   Can link and monitor Erlang from Python and Python from Erlang
*   `net_adm` pings supported
*   RPC calls to Python (Erlang `rpc:call`). Exceptions are propagated
    from Python back to Erlang;
*   `pyrlang.gen.server.GenServer` descendant from `pyrlang.process.Process`
    allows accepting generic calls mapped to Python class members
