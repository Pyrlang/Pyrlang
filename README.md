Pyrlang - Erlang node in Python
===============================

This is a drop-in Erlang node implementation in Python 3.5, implementing
a network Erlang node protocol. It was designed to allow interoperation between 
existing Python projects and BEAM languages: Erlang, Elixir, Alpaca, Luaerl, 
LFE, Clojerl and such. 

With just a few lines of startup code your Python program becomes an Erlang 
network node, participating in the Erlang cluster.

*   Send and receive messages locally and remotely by pid or name
*   Can link and monitor Erlang from Python and Python from Erlang
*   `net_adm` pings supported
