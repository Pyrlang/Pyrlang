Cookbook - How to Get Started
=============================

You might have come here to see some examples. Very well...
But have a quick look at :doc:`examples` page too!

Start the Node
--------------

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrlang import Node, Atom, GeventEngine # or AsyncioEngine

    def main():
        eng = GeventEngine()  # or AsyncioEngine
        node = Node(node_name="py@127.0.0.1", cookie="COOKIE", engine=eng)

        fake_pid = node.register_new_process()

        # To be able to send to Erlang shell by name first give it a
        # registered name: `erlang:register(shell, self()).`
        # To see an incoming message in shell: `flush().`
        node.send(sender=fake_pid,
                  receiver=(Atom('erl@127.0.0.1'), Atom('shell')),
                  message=Atom('hello'))

        eng.run_forever()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

Here ``event_engine`` is a pluggable adapter which allows Pyrlang to run both
with gevent (:py:class:`~pyrlang.Engine.gevent_engine.GeventEngine`)
and asyncio-driven (:py:class:`~pyrlang.Engine.asyncio_engine.AsyncioEngine`)
event loops. Pyrlang in this case performs mostly
protocols handling, while event engine will open connections, start tasks
and sleep asynchronously.


Connect nodes
-------------

.. note:: You can initiate the connection from either Erlang or Python side
    automatically by sending to a remote name using tuple format
    ``{Name, Node}`` or sending to a remote pid (if you have it).

You can initiate the connection between nodes from Erlang side in a different
way. To do this on Erlang side you can use ``net_adm:ping``.

.. code-block:: erlang

    net_adm:ping('py@127.0.0.1').

Also you could send a message to ``{Name, Node}``, where ``Node`` is an
atom like ``'py@127.0.0.1'``, and ``Name`` is a pid or some registered name,
which exists on the Python side.

.. code-block:: erlang

    {Name, 'py@127.0.0.1'} ! hello.

If the process exists on Python side, its ``inbox_`` field (which will be a
Gevent or Asyncio Queue) will receive your message.


RPC call from Erlang
--------------------

Python node has the special named process running, called ``'rex'``, which is
necessary for Erlang RPC to work. You can send an RPC call to Python from
Erlang. In the following example ``Pyrlang.logger`` module has a ``tty``
function which will transparently pass all args to the ``print`` operator.

.. code-block:: erlang

    rpc:call('py@127.0.0.1', 'Pyrlang.logger', 'tty', ["Hello World"]).

.. note::
    You do not need to import module to perform the call, this will be done by Rex.

.. note::
    Module and function name can be atoms, strings (non-unicode) or binaries.

Function call result or error will be sent back to the caller.
In case of error, Erlang exit exception will be created with the exception
value from Python.

``Rex`` also supports gen_server style calls from Erlang:

.. code-block:: erlang

    gen_server:call({rex, 'py@127.0.0.1'},
                    {call, 'Pyrlang.logger', tty, ["Hello"], self()}).


Send from Python locally
------------------------

You can send messages using the method
``Node.send(_sender, receiver, message)``, which can deliver messages
locally or remotely.

.. code-block:: python

    node.send(sender=None,  # argument unused
              receiver=term.Atom('my_erlang_process'),
              message=(123, 4.5678, [term.Atom('test')]))

Send from Python to a remote
----------------------------

You can send messages to a remote pid. Sender pid is unused and can be None.
The node connection will be established automatically.

.. code-block:: python

    node.send(sender=None,
              receiver=receiver_pid,
              message=Atom('hello'))

You can send messages to a remote named process, for this use tuple send format
like ``{Name, Node}``. For remote sends sender pid is REQUIRED,
even if it is a fake pid (see example below how to create a fake pid).

To try this, open an Erlang shell and register shell with the name ``'shell'``:

.. code-block:: erlang

    (erl@127.0.0.1) 1> erlang:register(shell, self())

Now we can try and send the message from Python (node connection will be
established automatically):

.. code-block:: python

    fake_pid = node.register_new_process(None)  # create a fake pid
    node.send(sender=fake_pid,
              receiver=(Atom('erl@127.0.0.1'), Atom('shell')),
              message=Atom('hello'))

.. code-block:: erlang

    (erl@127.0.0.1) 2> flush().
    Shell got hello
    ok
    (erl@127.0.0.1) 3>

Send to a Python object
-----------------------

A python object inherited from :py:class:`~pyrlang.process.Process` will be
a Greenlet (i.e. running in parallel with the rest of the system).
A process is able to register itself (optional) with a name and handle
incoming messages.

Messages sent to a pid or name will be automatically routed to such a
process and arrive into its ``self.inbox_``. The Process base class will
constantly call ``self.handle_inbox()`` so you can check the messages yourself.

.. note:: Because registering a process in the process dictionary introduces
    an extra reference to your object, be sure to tell it explicitly
    to unregister: call ``self.exit(reason=None)`` (defined in Process class).

.. code-block:: python

    class MyProcess(Process):
        def __init__(self, node) -> None:
            Process.__init__(self, node)
            node.register_name(self, Atom('my_process'))  # optional

        def handle_one_inbox_message(self, msg):
            print("Incoming", msg)

Now sending from Erlang is easy:

.. code-block:: erlang

    (erl@127.0.0.1) 1> {my_process, 'py@127.0.0.1'} ! hello.


Remote Calculations on Python Node
----------------------------------

**Problem:**
While it is possible to subclass the :py:class:`~pyrlang.process.Process`
class and implement a Erlang-like process, often existing Python code
exposes just a functional API or a class which has to be created for the
calculation to be performed.
Often you would like to use some functional API without sending the results
over the wire until they are ready.

**Solution:**
A notebook-like remote execution API, where intermediate call results are stored
in history log and can be referred by name or index.

There is helper Erlang module called ``py.erl``, please use it and see
:doc:`calling_python` for an example.


TODO Lazy Remote Calculations on Python Node
--------------------------------------------

**Problem:**
Same as with direct remote calculations: Often you would like to use some
functional API without sending the results over the wire until they are ready.
Lazy remote calculations API allows you to prebuild your calculation as a data
structure on Erlang side and then execute it remotely on one or more
Pyrlang nodes, sending you the final result.
Intermediate call results are stored in history log and can be referred by name
or index.

.. todo::
    Describe how to calculate chain of calls on a remote node **lazily**
    using the new API.


Gen_server-like Processes
-------------------------

To have a :py:class:`~pyrlang.process.Process` descendant which responds to
``gen_server:call``, inherit your class from :py:class:`~pyrlang.gen_server.GenServer`.
When calling ``GenServer`` constructor in your ``__init__`` specify an
additional parameter ``accepted_calls`` which is a list of strings.

Functions with these names will be mapped to incoming ``gen_server:call``
and their result will be transparently 'replied' back to the caller.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyProcess(GenServer):
        def __init__(self, node) -> None:
            GenServer.__init__(self, node, accepted_calls=['hello'])

        def hello(self):
            return self.pid_

When you perform a ``gen_server:call`` with an atom, the atom becomes Python
method name:

.. code-block:: python

    # 1> gen_server:call(Pid, my_method)
    # becomes a call to
    class MyClass:
        def my_method(self):
            pass # return None -> atom 'undefined' in Erlang

When you perform a ``gen_server:call`` with a tuple where first element is an
atom, the atom becomes Python method name, and following tuple elements become
python **\*args**.

.. code-block:: python

    # 1> gen_server:call(Pid, {my_method, 1000, "hello"})
    # becomes a call to
    class MyClass:
        def my_method(self, i: int, s: bytes):
            pass # return None -> atom 'undefined' in Erlang


Linking/Monitoring from Erlang to Python
----------------------------------------

See example6 in :doc:`examples`
for demo on linking a Pyrlang "process" to Erlang process, then
killing it and observing an EXIT signal coming back.

See example7 in :doc:`examples`
for demo on a Pyrlang "process" monitoring a Erlang process, then
killing it and observing the monitor message.


Linking/Monitoring from Python to Erlang
----------------------------------------

See example5 in :doc:`examples`
for demo on how Python can link and monitor local and remote pids.

.. note::
    To link two processes in Pyrlang use :py:class:`~pyrlang.node.Node`'s
    :py:meth:`~pyrlang.node.Node.link` method.

.. note::
    To monitor a process in Pyrlang use :py:class:`~pyrlang.node.Node`'s
    :py:meth:`~pyrlang.node.Node.monitor_process` method.
