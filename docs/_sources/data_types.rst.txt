Data Types in Pyrlang
=====================

Things to be aware about
------------------------

As we started this we've seen that there are some things that doesn't map
that good between python and erlang, and that the best solution for it could
be different pending on the problem you're currently trying to solve.

Erlang strings is more of syntactic sugar, but it is in fact a list of
integers with a value of less than 256. Since this interpretation is what is
sometime used when writing erlang code

.. code-block:: erlang

    some_module:with_function("this is a list of integers really").

one could be tempted to make this a unicode object which is the default for
python

.. code-block:: python

    some_module.with_function("this is a unicode object")

this however gives you some issues sine another time you might actually have
a list of integers you want to send to python but instead get a unicode
object. In python you generally don't handle list and unicode objects the same.

We have a pending state where we're testing around what would be the best
solution. Expect changes going forward and keep an eye out for changes in
default behaviour.

Lists
-----

Erlang lists can be of 2 kinds:

*   Regular lists of anything:

    *   Unicode strings, which are regular lists of integers in unicode range.
    *   8-bit strings, sometimes called latin-1 or ASCII, which are regular lists
        of bytes.

* Improper lists (those with last cell's tail being not ``[] NIL``).

Pyrlang always decodes incoming regular lists as Python lists,
use helper functions in :py:mod:`~term.list` to extract strings.
If incoming string contained only bytes (integers between 0 and 255) then
Erlang node will optimize the encoding and send a byte array. In this case you
will receive Python ``bytes`` string, and not a list, which is
**the same as if you have sent a binary**, so to reduce confusion always send
strings as UTF8 binaries.

A regular Erlang list always has an invisible ``[]`` (``NIL``) set as tail of
its last cons cell. Regular lists map directly to Python lists and
**there is no easy way to tell a list of integers from a string** other than
check elements ranges and assume that is a printable string. Unless you received
Python ``bytes`` then it's easy.

An improper Erlang list has some other value than ``[] NIL`` as the tail of
its last cell.
Pyrlang returns these as Python tuple ``(list, tail)``.
To tell Pyrlang encoder to send an improper list back to Erlang, use the
:py:class:`~term.list.ImproperList` class.


Binaries
--------

Pyrlang always decodes incoming Erlang binaries into Python ``bytes`` objects.

Bitstrings are decoded as Python pairs of ``(bytes, last_byte_bits:int)``
To be able to send a bitstring back to Erlang, use class
:py:class:`~term.bitstring.BitString`.
