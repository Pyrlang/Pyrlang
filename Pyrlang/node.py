    """ Implements an Erlang node which has a network name, a dictionary of 
        processes and registers itself via EPMD.
        Node handles the networking asynchronously.

        This is the root object of an Erlang node, it must be created first and
        must outlive all other objects it manages, for them to be accessible
        over the network.

        Usage example:

        1. Monkey patch with the help of Gevent: ``from gevent import monkey``
            and then ``monkey.patch_all()``.

        2. Create a node class with a name and a cookie
            ``node = Pyrlang.Node("py@127.0.0.1", "COOKIE")``

        3. Start it with ``node.start()``

        4. Now anything that you do (for example an infinite loop with
            ``gevent.sleep(1)`` in it, will give CPU time to the node.

        .. note:: Node is a singleton, you can find the current node by
